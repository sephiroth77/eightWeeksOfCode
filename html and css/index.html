     <h1>Who This Message Is For</h1>
	 <p>This message is intended for W.A and staff in response to G.O's request to view examples of code I have worked on, both personal and academic.

	     <p>My name is Adrian Aleman. I am a strong believer of Christ, a husband to an amazing wife, a full time student at the University of Central Florida, a full time programming teacher/math tutor, with a part time math tutoring position. So let us say I am an overtime math tutor. I am also due to graduate with my Bachelors in Software Development in the Spring of 2020.</br></p>
	     <h2>Why I Want This Position</h2>
			<p>First of all, I want to make it known that I love God. I don't have any other path but His and I understand the sacrifice that was made for us and the war that we were born into. I'd also like to make it clear that I understand this submission to W.A is approximately 8 Weeks Late. Coincidence? </br>Probably not. The truth is that I am deeply sorry for taking so long in turning in this work of mine. I wanted it all to be optimal and I wanted to be as competent as possible. However, through this search I realized that a huge aspect that enables someone to reach their goals (in my case to help a vast majority of the population) is as simple as getting started. I love what W.A stands for. I love that they honor God and are eager to share God's word and implement it into our everyday technology. I am passionate about this opportunity, I can't stress that enough. From what I have gathered, this ministry is a blessing and I would be overjoyed for the opportunity to be a part of it.</p>
			<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>I will not be making this as pretty and complex as I could before submission because if that was the case I'll always be improving it and you, the reader, may never get it, which is one of the last things I want to happen.
