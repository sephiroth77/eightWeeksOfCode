     <h1>The Java Folder</h1>
     <p>Okay, in the java folder you will see a personal folder and a school folder.
	 </br>The personal folder will have a simple program. It is the beginning product of a game that enables you to roll two dice. The program will calculate the sum of your rolls and display the output. From here I will implement a way to restart the program without having to leave it.
	 </br>The school folder will have parts of various assignments I have worked on academically.</p>
	 <p>This includes:</p> 
		<ul>
	 		<li>Two sorting techniques algorithms (QuickSort and SelectionSort) and a few supporting java files</li>
			<li>An algorithm that identifies different types of sequences</li>
			<li>Some work with XML(a class that provides a set of utility methods to manage XML) and supporting documents</li>
		</ul>
