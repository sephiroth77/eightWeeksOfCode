     <h1>The Python Folder</h1>
     <p>Okay, in the python folder you will see a ff invasion folder and a work folder.
	 </br>The ff invasion folder holds the components of an alien invasion game that is similar to Space Invaders. The blue print of this game was given in a book, 'Python Crash Course' by Eric Matthes. This is the book I use to teach my programming class. I made some modifications and this is what you see. To run the game you must run the alien_invasion.py file.
	 </br>In my class, I will at times hold a game club depending on their progress. The program in the work folder ramdomly selects an opponent and makes sure that everyone must play before one can play again.</p>

	<p>Thank you, WA, for the chance to work with you. I am truly passionate about the possibility of working for such a tremendous cause. In reality, it is the most important cause in all of humanity.
